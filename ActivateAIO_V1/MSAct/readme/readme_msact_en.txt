 			             The purpose of the program
                                     ————————————————————————————
The program is intended for installation key and activate Windows 7-10 and Office 2010-2013.
If the set key enables activation over the network, via the Internet, the product is activated
automatically, if this does not happen and the key is not blocked - the code is issued to transfer M$
Activation Center to activate by phone.
Unlike MSAct in the program MSAct Plus has the ability to create groups of keys for
different products.

                                       Work with the program
                                     ————————————————————————————
1. Select a product to install key and activation;
2. Type in the input box key the key for the selected product;
3. Click "Set key".

If the set key enables activation over the network, via the Internet, the product is activated
automatically, otherwise, if the key is not blocked, in boxes 1-9 display the code for sending 
the Activation Center M$ to activate by phone.
To activate by phone, you must call the Activation Center, send the code of the fields "1-9"
and to get the return code that must be entered in the field "A-H" and click "Apply".
If everything is completed without errors, the product is activated.
When activation is completed, you can save the key and the return code into a text file using 
special button. Subsequently, for example, after reinstalling the system, rather
will set key to enter the program previously stored return code and click "Apply".
Recovery activation is possible even if the key is already blocked.

*** If you copy to the clipboard saved response code and set the cursor to the fileld "A", the code
will be inserted automatically.
*** A button near the block "9" forcibly displays the code for transmitting to the Center
Activation, even if the key is blocked. This enables you to activate by phone, for
keys held online activation.

                                      Working with Database Keys
                                     ————————————————————————————
In the window Database Keys you can create your own group of keys, delete, add to group keys from the clipboard
share, load groups in the field for entering the key. After loading the group is available
automatic program mode. In this mode, all keys are processed by turns, until the product will be activated or end a list of keys.
